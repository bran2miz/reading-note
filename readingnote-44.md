# Reading 16 - Serverless Functions

## What is Serverless?

**serverless** - cloud computing execution model

Serverless can:

- Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code or in response to a specific event

- Auto scales said resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand.

- Auto scales resources to zero when application stops running.

### Serverless Pros vs Cons

#### Pros

1.*Offloads* all management duties for backend cloud infrastructure and operational tasks to cloud provider.
-it gives more time to innovate and optimize front-end app functionality and business logic.

2.Customers pay for execution **only**
-pay when the request is made up until the execution is finished.

3.It is a *polyglot* environment
-allows developers to code in all different programming languages or frameworks: Java, Python, node.js

4.Simplifies *deployment* and simplifies *DevOp cycles*.
-there is no requirement to detail on infrastructure.

5.*Faster* and more *cost-effective* than other forms of compute.

#### Cons

1.Does not have the same time saving efficiency for workloads that are predictable, steady or long running processes.
-*spiky* workloads have **significant** cost savings

2.Sometimes it is required for serverless to restart from zero to serve a new request.
-serverless architectures forgo long-running processes in favor of scaling up and down to zero. This could be **detrimental** to companies that require no delays.

3.More arduous task to *monitor* and *debug* serverless functions with limiting tools or processes.

4.Could potentially cause a material *lock-in* within an ecosystem of the managed cloud services.
