# Class 01 - Reading Notes

## Pain and Suffering

**Pain of Growth**- seek the remedy by:
-asking questions
-build resources and community

*note* **suffering** is pain *without* purpose. Pain while hurtful pulls us out of our comfort zone.

*"Suffering is dependent on the story that we layer on top of our pain".*

## Beginners Guide to Big O

**Big O notation**- algorithmic notation that showcases the intricacy of algorithms.

**O(1)** - algorithm that correlates with the input data set and linearly grows.

**O(N)** - algorithm that runs even if there are varying data sets.

**O(N^2)**- algorithm that correlates with the size of the input data set that is *square*.

**O(2^N)** - algorithm that *doubles* based on the further implementation of more data sets.

**O(logN)** or **Logarithms**- algorithm that halves data sets in whic hthe outcome results in a curve that starts at its highest, then slowly slopes the size of data sets.

## Names and Values of Python

Python- simplistic mechanics in which the effects can be surprising

-Names refer to **values**

-Values live until no more references
  -Immutable values can't be changed in place.

-Assignment never copies data 

-Changes are visible through all names

-Mutable aliasing
  -happens when there is mutable value

-Mutable and immutable are exactly the same for all values. Changing is what is altered and can result in different effects.

-**Names** have no type and **values** have no scope
