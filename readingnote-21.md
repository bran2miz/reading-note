# Reading 07 - REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
  Created the first web servers and gave evidence of how and why the World Wide Web functions the way it does.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  The techniques were not designed to be handled like that. Need to be able to not just talk to a small group of machines but all the machines around the world.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  Applying verbs to nouns; The browser essentially performs an HTTP GET within the URL and then displays a web page. 

What does a GET do?
  *Request* information (*get* something)

What does a POST do?
  *Adds* information (*create*)

What does PUT do?
  *Modifies* existing information

What does PATCH do?
  *Partially* modifies existing information

## API Keys
