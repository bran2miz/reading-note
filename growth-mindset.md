# The Growth Mindset

Before joining Code Fellows--> "For myself, I am very much in a fixed mindset. I am always second-guessing myself and believe that I cannot change. I avoid and detract away from obstacles, mainly because I don't like to fail. The worst feeling was the my idea that risk-taking leads to FAILURE.

However, by taking this first step in joining CodeFellows, I feel like I am beginning to develop a growth mindset.

Even though this is just the start, growth mindset is the desire to want to make changes in your life, believing in yourself, and drowning out the sound that tells you that you can't.

Remind yourself that you are able to succeed.
Be willing and open to make mistakes, and get back up if you fail.
Even the darkest of times, have a positive mental attitude to difficult challenges that may come. I truly believe that through positivity, eventually one can persevere and come out of arduous situations stronger than ever."

Upon reading this when I first started Code Fellows, I am really proud of where I am now. When I first started Code Fellows, I was not fulfilled in my career in Los Angeles. I was also really nervous about whether I was competent enough to learn code in a very short amount of time. All of my bias about myself have slowly melted away, most notably after my 301 final project. I think of the major reasons why I was able to endure the difficult days where code was broken and was extremely frustrated was deep breathing and a positive mental attitude. The reassurance that many of my fellow classmates were also experiencing similar feelings made me feel not alone. I feel immensely stronger than I did when I first started at Code Fellows, and more confident in code than i thought i could and knew before.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.

-Power of not yet-- Doesn't make you feel like a failure; it provides you with optimism and hope for the future.

-The idea that abilities could be developed is known as the **growth mindset**.

- One of the more compelling parts of Carol's speech was the expression the *tyranny of now*. I thought that was very profound that failure can lead one into a downward spiral, eventually causing those to feel depressed, cheat, or look to find others that did worse. Carol's speech was really informative about the growth mindset, especially in areas that have seen many students under-perform. In those particular areas, she had mentioned that students were only taught that failure is inevitable. However if teachers and school faculties could change the perception, via a change in mindset and the power of *yet*, students could outperform and succeed.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- What I got from this TedTalk on grit, was the power of **perseverance**. I think many times, people in general give up because they believe that they are not good enough. In Angela's talk, she mentioned that a lot of the time, feelings of incompetency are a result of people not feeling intelligent enough, or their IQ does not meet standards of society. However, where succession is determined is actually by *grit*. Through passion and perseverance, one can do and be extraordinary.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- This TedTalk was about redefining success. The first part of the TedTalk was about career anxiety, which are drawn from a number of bias. Job snobbery, or the questions of "what do you do?", makes us fearful of having a career that society tells us is "a good job". Our fear of failure causes us to be anxious of being successful in order to not be ridiculed or being passed "judgment". After watching this video, I realized that as humans, we can't be perfect at everything. In life, there is an element of loss in which work life, private life, relationships, etc are always hanging in the balance, and if one of them starts to lower, we instantly link it to failure. We should focus on our own ambitions and convictions, and not be persuaded by other influences and bias.
